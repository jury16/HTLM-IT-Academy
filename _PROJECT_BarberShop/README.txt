The general requirements for the project are as follows:
The project must contain at least 5 pages.
Content should relate to one topic and be realistic, meaningful.
Pictures and images in the content should also be matched to the subject of the project.
The layout should be neat and commented in the right places.
The files should be located in logical folders, for example, html is at the root, and the rest of the files are in the js (scripts), styles (css), fonts, images folders. The main page is index.html, the rest should be named according to logic or content.
All images must be in the correct format and optimized, you can and should use sprites or icon fonts where necessary.
HTML5 tags are encouraged, such as header, nav, section, sidebar, article, footer, form + fields, figure + figcaption;
The names of classes and classes-modifiers should carry a semantic load and indicate the functions \ type \ position of elements (the BEM methodology can be used). Don't use id for styling.
Menus, pagination, breadcrumbs are executed as nav> ul> li> a (see https://emmet.io/)
The footer should be nailed to the bottom. "Hit" - if you remove the content on the page, except for the footer, then the footer will still be at the bottom of the viewport, but if there is a lot of content, then the footer will be at the bottom of the content, and not overlap it.
Header can be fixed or sticky when scrolling.
Layout must be validated HTML (https://validator.w3.org/), CSS (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and general (https://validator.w3.org/unicorn/ ? ucn_lang = ru) without errors and warnings.
Any third-party libraries and frameworks can be used on the site (for example, jQuery, Less or SCSS, but do not use such frameworks as BULMA, Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.), provided that you fully understand why they are needed in a particular case and are ready to answer to questions about their use.
Any third-party components (for example, sliders, photo galleries, etc.) can be used on the site, provided they are correctly integrated into the project (i.e. without errors, warnings in the console) and you fully understand how they are configured and styled.
All interactive elements (links, forms, buttons, etc.) must have styles for all states (hover, active, focus) where they are implied.
It is necessary to use animations, transformations and scripts to "animate" interactive elements on the page. If there is a map on the layout, make it interactive (read as an example - https://www.kasper.by/blog/kak-vstavit-kartu-proezda-iz-google-yandex/)
The site must be fully responsive, up to 320 pixels in the width of the viewport. Without any horizontal scrolling.
The layout will be checked in the following browsers:
Google chrome
Mozilla Firefox
Safari (optional)
Microsoft Edge
Internet Explorer 11-10 (optional)
Emulators on android or iOS

* optional - if explicitly asked for it or indicated in the requirements for the project.
